# Best Case : O(n) ^2 even if list is sorted, we must still check each element with 2 inner loops

        ALGORITHM:
        *********

1. Start outter Loop from i=0 to length of list
2. Start inner Loop from i=i+1 to length of list
3. Check of current element in inner loop is less than current element in outter loop
4 If yes, swap both

'''



    # start at index 0
    # find the smallest item in the list from 1 to n-1
        # after finding, compare elemnt at n with each element of array
            # if smaller that current_small element
                # swap
